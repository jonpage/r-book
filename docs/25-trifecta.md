# How to Judge Visualizations {-#trifecta}

Read [Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html)

[Kaiser Fung](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/biography.html) has a
useful framework for judging the quality of data visualizations. He calls his framework
the
[Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/junk-charts-trifecta-checkup-the-definitive-guide.html). To make that shorter, we'll just call this
framework the *Trifecta Checkup*. This framework boils down to the following 3 questions:

1. What is the **question**?
2. What does the **data** say?
3. What does the **visual** say?

Each visualization can be labeled according to which question(s) it does not answer 
well. For example, a chart with a meaningful question and relevant data, but ineffective visuals, would be labeled **v**. A chart that gets the data and question wrong, but has a nice visual, would be labeled **qd**.
